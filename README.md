- https://www.nuget.org/packages/RawgNET

### General
- Through methods, like GetGame and IsGameExisting you can check if a game exists or get the data of it.
- Through methods, like GetCreators, GetCreator and IsCreatorExisting you can check if a creator exists or get the data of them.

## Usage

## Example

```
RawgClient client = new(new ClientOptions("YOUR KEY FROM https://rawg.io/apidocs"));
const string query = "gtav";

Console.WriteLine($"Querying the input {query}");

if (await client.IsGameExisting(query))
{
	Game game = await client.GetGame(query, true, true);
	Console.WriteLine($"Name: {game.NameOriginal} - Rating: {game.Rating}");

	if (game.ScreenshotsAvailable)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"First screenshot: {game.Screenshots.First().Image}");
	}
	if (game.AchievementsAvailable)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"First achievement: {game.Achievements.First().Name}");
	}
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Game does not exist!");
}

Console.WriteLine();

string SomeExistingCreatorsId = "444";
Creator cr = await client.GetCreator(SomeExistingCreatorsId);

Console.WriteLine($"The creator with id {SomeExistingCreatorsId}");
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {cr.Name} - Image: {cr.Image}");
```

## FAQ

#### Does this work on every OS?

I created this on Windows 10 and tested it on other Windows 10 machines, I can't guarantee anything for other operating systems or versions. But it should work everywhere, where Core 6 works.

#### Where do I get an API-Key?

At https://rawg.io/apidocs, just press the "Get API Key" button.

#### What do I have to be aware of?

Rawg.io has terms of use, please read them and be sure to comply to them - https://api.rawg.io/docs/
